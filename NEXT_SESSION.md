# Next Session Handoff

## Repository state

- Checkout: `main` at or newer than the Milestone A integration commit `077911b469bf7026364c0335e748114bf8df05c0` (a state-reconciliation docs commit follows it); `origin/main` synchronized
- Milestone A (canvas tangent handles) is integrated into `main` by approved replay + fast-forward; `main` is a strict superset of its previous state
- Task 105 (export diagnostics UX) and Task 107 (track-matte source selection) are integrated by fast-forward; both are retained
- Workflow-tested release code candidate (tag target): `46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6`
- Release tags: `v1.1.0-rc.1` (annotated) and `v1.1.0-public-controls`, both unchanged
- Branches kept: `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` (Milestone A review artefact) and `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay` (identical to `main`; deleting it needs approval)

## Current result

Milestone A — direct canvas tangent handle authoring — is merged and live in `main`:

- Selecting a single freeform layer in edit mode shows its vertices on the stage; clicking a vertex reveals its Bezier tangent handles; dragging a handle reshapes the rendered path live; double-clicking a vertex toggles corner ↔ smooth with neighbour-derived symmetric handles.
- One history entry per completed drag; `Escape` cancels an in-flight drag, restores the previous handles, and records nothing.
- Out of scope (unchanged): vertex add/remove, multi-vertex transforms, keyboard nudging, handle constraints, boolean or trim-enabled freeform layers, broadcast mode.
- Integration: branch `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` was replayed onto current `main` as `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay` and fast-forward merged; no rebase, no merge commit, no force push, no history rewrite. Documentation/handoff conflicts were resolved in favour of the newest content, and `docs/KCS_GROUPED_ROADMAP_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (which only exists on `main`) was preserved and updated.
- Review: six independent rounds; the final verdict was `READY` with all five findings closed (verification matrix, legacy points normalization, selection model, Escape/batch lifecycle, smooth-handle/extreme-coordinate edge).

The release stance is unchanged: annotated tag `v1.1.0-rc.1` and a GitHub draft prerelease exist at the workflow-tested code candidate; nothing was published, finalized, or pushed to npm.

## Validation

Full Vitest (108 files / 1,641 tests), `npm run validate:ograf`, `npm run qa:release` (2 Chromium tests, candidate SHA `077911b`), `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `git diff --check`, the permanent real-browser spec `e2e/canvas-tangent-authoring.spec.ts`, and CI run `35206117254` on `main` all pass. Existing Fast Refresh, Vite chunk-size, and npm install-script warnings remain.

## Next scoped work

1. Land **Milestone C — first export / onboarding flow (roadmap item 5)**: it is implemented on `feat/export-onboarding` (branch commit `73b22a2`, report `reports/progress_110_export_onboarding.md`) and awaits the review gate and a fast-forward merge. Nothing else needs to be built for it. Scope recap: a short first-successful-OGraf-export path for new users, reusing the Task 105 export diagnostics, the existing export UI, and the existing project templates; no host/vendor contract invention, no OGraf package format change, no new dependency, no package/workflow/release change.
2. Milestones D–F stay plan-only; **D's dependency/package part (item 9) requires explicit user approval** before any `package.json`/lockfile work, and all release/tag/draft-release changes need explicit approval.
3. Preserve the tag and draft release, and run an independent review before every merge.
4. Publish/finalize the GitHub draft only with further explicit user instruction.

## Guardrails

- Do not reset, force-push, rebase, tag, or delete branches/reports. Integrate by fast-forward, or by an approved replay.
- Do not modify `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\ograf-graphics`.
- Keep `.omp/config.yml`, model roles, provider mappings, task concurrency, and global tooling unchanged.
- Keep `origin/without-mask` untouched and classified ARCHIVE.
- Production draft is not published; publish/finalize requires further explicit user instruction.

## ChatGPT handoff policy

- `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a per-response, task-specific upload bundle: clean it first, then place only the files that this specific ChatGPT conversation needs.
- Preferred upload artifact: `chatgpt_handoff/CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` is regenerated from scratch for each task/milestone. Before writing it, delete or overwrite the old file. Build it only from the current `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` bundle plus `latest/OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md`. Do not append old content, do not preserve previous task sections, and do not use it as an archive. If a historical handoff archive is ever needed, create a separate explicitly named archive file under `chatgpt_handoff/archive/` only after user approval. The default ChatGPT upload is always this one file.
- Handoff documents must state one current truth: never append a correction block on top of stale sections — rewrite the stale section instead.
- Never store flattened source or test copies there. Those copies are separate files, and the ones named `src__*test*` are picked up by the Vitest default include glob, which breaks CI.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user's project/asset folder, not a handoff dump. Never copy the bundle there unless the user explicitly asks.
- Omitted files are never deleted from the repository; they simply are not part of the bundle.

## Milestone B merged — graph + keyboard accessibility

- Branch `feat/graph-accessibility` was fast-forward-merged into `main` at `96e8f9d0313cb81752c04fe58d6e7d00d700a6f4` (no merge commit, no rebase, no history rewrite).
- What it adds: timeline keyframe diamonds are named, focusable buttons (`Enter`/`Space` selects the keyframe and moves the playhead, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` walk focus along the lane in frame order and are consumed at the ends); the value graph is a labelled group whose keyframe points are Tab-reachable and announced with frame and value, editable with the arrow keys; decorative SVG geometry is hidden from assistive technology; the selected-keyframe panel is a group scoped to its frame; focus rings were added for the diamonds and the graph points.
- Review: one focused round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 documentation over-claims) — all closed; the re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS.
- Validation: 109 files / 1,652 Vitest tests, `validate:ograf`, `qa:release`, build, TypeScript, lint, `git diff --check`, plus the real-browser spec `e2e/graph-accessibility.spec.ts`.
- Out of scope (unchanged): graph engine or evaluator changes, new shortcut registry, keyframe model or drag redesign, new dependencies, release/package/workflow changes.
- Next roadmap milestone: **C — first export / onboarding flow (item 5)**; plan-only, not started.
