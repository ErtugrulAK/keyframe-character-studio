# KCS ChatGPT One-File Handoff

---

## 0. Upload Instructions

- This file is always the latest current handoff.
- It is overwritten/rebuilt for every task; the previous file is deleted before writing.
- It is not an archive, and old task sections are never appended or preserved.
- It is generated only from `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` plus `latest/OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md`.
- Upload only `chatgpt_handoff\CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` to ChatGPT; the files in `chatgpt_handoff\latest` are its sources.
- The repository root is `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\keyframe-character-studio`.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user project/asset workspace, not a handoff destination; nothing was copied there.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\ograf-graphics` is untouched by this workflow.

## 1. OMP Final Response

# KCS Milestone F Item 12 — Final Response (Unified Import Entry)

This file is the OMP final response for this task. It is copied into `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` and included verbatim in `chatgpt_handoff/CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md`.

## 1) RESULT

- **Status:** done and merged. `feat/unified-import-entry` was fast-forward merged into `main` at `ce6cec2` (base `main` was `81b87a3`) and pushed; the branch is kept.
- **Report:** `reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md`.
- One import control replaces the fragmented ones, and it decides what a file is from its **content**, never from its name alone.

## 2) WHAT CHANGED

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/utils/importDispatch.ts` | New `classifyImport(fileName, text)`: package names first, then the boundary size gate (no parse), then one parse shared by an OGraf-schema check and a Lottie shape check, with the KCS scene/legacy decision delegated to `validateImportedDocument` |
| `src/components/Header/HeaderBar.tsx` | One `Import` button and input (`.json`, `.kcs`, `.lottie.json`, `.ograf.json`, `.zip`, `.ograf`) whose label names every accepted kind; the separate `Import Lottie` control is gone; the handler routes each kind to its existing behaviour |
| `src/components/Modal/ImportReportDialog.{tsx,css}` | The Lottie report dialog generalised with a `title` prop (renamed from `LottieImportReportDialog`) so the OGraf package slice can reuse it; its accessibility, sanitiser, blocker-first order and 40-entry cap are unchanged |
| `src/tests/importDispatch.test.ts` | New, 4 cases: the classification matrix, content-over-extension, the unclassifiable cases, the OGraf-marker precedence and the oversized route |
| `src/tests/lottieImportEntry.test.tsx` | 13 cases rewritten around the single control: report/cancel/apply, KCS import, OGraf rejection, unclassifiable refusal, refusal dialog, focus trap, sanitisation, cap |
| `e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts` | 2 browser tests: the Lottie report flow, and a `.kcs` project importing through the same control while a refused file changes nothing |

## 3) VALIDATION

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) | PASS |
| focused suites (`importDispatch`, `lottieImportEntry`, `lottieImport`) | PASS — 105 cases |
| `npm test` (full Vitest) | PASS — 122 files / 1,841 tests |
| `npm run lint` | clean |
| `npm run validate:ograf` | PASS |
| `npm run qa:release` | PASS — 2 Chromium smoke tests |
| `npx playwright test e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts` | PASS — 2 real-browser tests |
| `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | clean |

## 4) REVIEW

Three independent read-only rounds (`reviewer-agent`, evidence-cited):

| Round | Verdict | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | BLOCKED | The dispatcher parsed before applying the boundary's size gate; the canonical OGraf schema (`ograf.ebu.io`) was not recognised by content, only by the `/ograf/` substring and the file name; the control's accessible label did not name the legacy and package kinds; the new tests missed both the canonical-schema and the oversized cases |
| 2 | BLOCKED | The OGraf marker had been moved behind the KCS shape check, so an OGraf-marked document that also carried a KCS shape could reach the project authority |
| 3 | READY WITH WARNINGS | Every blocker closed; the remaining notes were a duplicated changelog bullet, stale test counts in the report and a misplaced import — all fixed |

The production fixes: the size gate now runs before any parse (so an oversized document is never parsed by the dispatcher), the canonical `OGRAF_GRAPHICS_SCHEMA_URL` authority is reused instead of a substring, and the OGraf marker wins over the KCS shape so an OGraf document can never be applied as a project.

## 5) SAFETY

- The validated import boundary is still the only path that turns text into a project, and `importProject` still validates before it applies anything.
- `.kcs`, legacy, OGraf manifest and OGraf package outcomes are unchanged; the OGraf kinds keep their existing messages.
- Lottie still reports before it replaces, and cancel still performs no mutation, no save and no toast.
- No network or filesystem access; the document text is the only input.
- No renderer/evaluator change, no dependency, and no `package.json`, lockfile or workflow change.
- Tag `v1.1.0-rc.1` (`46d2a3e…`), the GitHub draft release, npm metadata, `origin/without-mask`, the OMP configuration and the user folders are unchanged.
- Integration was fast-forward only: no merge commit, no rebase, no force push, no tag change, no branch deletion.

## 6) NEXT

The OGraf package/editable import expansion (the next task of this orchestrator run), reusing
`ImportReportDialog` and the same validated apply path; then the approval-gated package and toolchain
follow-ups (Option B, `engines`/`allowScripts`, Option C).

## 2. Handoff Manifest

# KCS ChatGPT Upload Manifest — Milestone F Item 12 (Unified Import Entry)

Clean refreshed: YES
Bundle purpose: one content-classified import control replacing the fragmented entry points (Milestone F item 12)
Bundle scope: minimal and task-specific; this folder is not an archive

Branch: feat/unified-import-entry, fast-forward merged into main at ce6cec2 (base main was 81b87a3) and pushed; the branch is kept
Task record: reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md; design: docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_MAPPING.md context in docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md (in the repository)
What changed: src/utils/importDispatch.ts (content-first classifier), src/components/Header/HeaderBar.tsx (one Import control + dispatch), src/components/Modal/ImportReportDialog.{tsx,css} (the Lottie report dialog generalised with a title prop), src/tests/importDispatch.test.ts (4 cases, new), src/tests/lottieImportEntry.test.tsx (13 cases), e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts (2 browser tests)
Not changed: no renderer/evaluator change, no dependency, package.json, lockfile or workflow change; the .kcs, legacy, OGraf manifest and OGraf package outcomes are unchanged
Validation: npm run build PASS; focused suites PASS (105 cases); full suite PASS (122 files / 1,841 tests); lint clean; npm run validate:ograf PASS; npm run qa:release PASS (2 Chromium tests); npx playwright test e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts PASS (2 tests); git diff --check clean
Reviews: three independent read-only rounds — BLOCKED, BLOCKED, READY WITH WARNINGS — every blocker closed (unbounded parse before the size gate; the canonical OGraf schema not recognised by content; the OGraf marker losing to the KCS shape)
Next work (each needs its own approval): OGraf package/editable import expansion; then the approval-gated package/toolchain follow-ups (Option B, engines/allowScripts, Option C)
v1.1.0-rc.1 tag target: 46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6 (unchanged)

## 3. Bundle README

# KCS Minimal ChatGPT Upload Bundle — Milestone F Item 12 Unified Import Entry

This is a minimal, task-specific ChatGPT upload bundle. It was clean-refreshed for this task.

## What this bundle covers

The unified import entry (Milestone F item 12), merged into `main` at `ce6cec2`:

- One **Import** control in the header. The selected file is classified by what it **contains**, so a
  KCS project, a legacy project, an OGraf manifest/package and a Lottie animation all reach their
  existing importer (and the refusals) through the same button.
- A Lottie animation still parses in memory and opens a report that lists its blockers and losses
  with their source paths and next steps **before** anything is applied; **Cancel** clears the pending
  import and nothing else, and only **Import and replace project** applies the scene through the same
  validated path the project import uses.
- Imported Lottie layer types stay ones the editor renders and the OGraf export accepts, and Lottie's
  relative tangents become the absolute handles the renderer reads, so the imported geometry draws
  what the source drew.

## Files

- `OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md` — the final response for this task
- `progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md` — the task record
- `KCS_GROUPED_ROADMAP_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` — the roadmap with the Milestone F status
- `CHANGELOG.md` — the repository changelog
- `NEXT_SESSION.md` — repository state and the current next action
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — project state, validation status and the handoff policy
- `manifest.txt` — this bundle's inventory

`NEXT_SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `KCS_GROUPED_ROADMAP_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`
are copies of their root documents; `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` compares them after
CRLF→LF normalization and a whole-document `trim()` and fails on content drift.

## Deliberately not included

Source, test and design files are intentionally omitted (they live in the repository). Flattened
copies named `src__*test*` previously matched Vitest's default include glob and broke CI. Also
omitted: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, CI/release workflows, older reports,
release/current-state documents, QA output, assets, archives, and caches.

Omitted files were not deleted from the repository; they are simply not part of this bundle.

## Staging note

`C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user's project/asset workspace, not a handoff destination.
Nothing was copied there, and nothing should be.

Upload only `chatgpt_handoff\CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` to ChatGPT. The files in this folder are its sources.

## 4. Task Record

# Progress 128 — Unified Import Entry (Milestone F item 12)

## 1. Scope

One controlled user-facing import entry replaces the fragmented ones. The header now offers a single
**Import** control that decides from the file's **content** what it is and routes it to the importer
that owns that kind:

| Kind | Route | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `.kcs` scene | `importProject` (the validated boundary) | Unchanged: applied immediately, warnings shown as an info toast |
| Legacy project | `importProject` | Unchanged: applied immediately with the `KCS_IMPORT_LEGACY_MIGRATED` warning |
| Lottie (`.json`/`.lottie.json`) | `importLottieDocument` + report dialog | Report before replace; cancel is a no-op |
| OGraf manifest (`.ograf.json` or an OGraf `$schema`) | existing rejection message | Unchanged |
| OGraf package (`.zip`/`.ograf`) | existing rejection message | Unchanged — package import is item 12's later slice |
| Anything else | `importProject` (its own refusal) | Unchanged refusal message |

Out of scope by instruction: new OGraf editable-import conversion, package/lockfile/workflow edits and
new dependencies.

## 2. Branch

`feat/unified-import-entry`, created from `main` at `81b87a3`.

## 3. Existing authorities reused

| Authority | Where | How this slice uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `validateImportedDocument` (the validated import boundary) | `src/utils/importValidation.ts` | The scene/legacy decision comes from its `document.kind`; no second classifier for KCS shapes exists |
| `importProject` | `src/hooks/useSerialization.ts` | Still the only apply path for project documents; it validates first and never partially applies |
| `importLottieDocument` | `src/interop/lottie/mapDocument.ts` | The Lottie parse, unchanged |
| `ImportReportDialog` (was `LottieImportReportDialog`) | `src/components/Modal/ImportReportDialog.tsx` | Generalised with a `title` prop so the next slice (OGraf package import) reuses the same surface; its a11y, sanitiser, blocker-first order and 40-entry cap are unchanged |
| `useToast`, `sanitizeOGrafDiagnosticText` | existing | Unchanged feedback and display safety |

## 4. Entry point

One button and one file input in the header:

- `Import` — "Import a KCS project, a legacy project, an OGraf manifest or a Lottie animation".
- `accept=".json,.kcs,.lottie.json,.ograf.json,.zip,.ograf"`, with an `aria-label` naming all kinds.

The previous separate `Import Lottie` button and input are gone; the old routing (OGraf rejection
included) is preserved inside the single handler.

## 5. Dispatch

`src/utils/importDispatch.ts` — `classifyImport(fileName, text)`:

- A package form (`.zip`/`.ograf`) is decided by name because it is a binary archive that is never
  read as text.
- An OGraf manifest is recognised by its `.ograf.json` name **or** an OGraf `$schema` marker, which
  keeps the previous behaviour for manifests whose schema URL has no `/ograf/` segment.
- Everything else is decided by content: `validateImportedDocument` first (scene vs legacy), then a
  Lottie check (`v` string + `layers` array + a timing field, and not an OGraf manifest). The Lottie
  check is skipped for documents above the boundary's 32 MB limit.
- A file that fits nothing is `unknown` and is handed to `importProject`, which refuses it with its
  own diagnostic — the existing behaviour, unchanged.

Because the content decides, a document renamed `.kcs` still imports as what it holds, and a `.json`
that is really an OGraf manifest is still refused with the OGraf message.

## 6. Report / cancel / apply semantics

- Lottie: selecting the file parses it in memory and opens the report; **Cancel** (button, Escape or
  backdrop) clears the pending state only — no project mutation, no history entry, no autosave, no
  toast; **Import and replace project** applies through `importProject`.
- KCS/legacy/unknown: unchanged immediate behaviour (validate → apply → toast).
- A refusal from either side never reports success.

## 7. Security / privacy boundaries

- No network or filesystem access: the document text is the only input, and an external image source
  is still only reported by the Lottie importer.
- Every rendered value in the report passes the display sanitiser.
- The boundary's protections (size limit, JSON syntax, prototype-key walk, layer-count limit) are
  unchanged, and the dispatcher adds no parsing of its own beyond a bounded Lottie shape check.

## 8. Tests

| Test | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `src/tests/importDispatch.test.ts` (new, 4 cases) | The classification matrix for every kind; content beats extension (a `.kcs` holding Lottie, a `.lottie.json` holding a scene); unclassifiable input, a Lottie-shaped object without timing, and a prototype-key document are all `unknown` |
| `src/tests/lottieImportEntry.test.tsx` (13 cases) | The single control drives the Lottie report, the KCS import, the OGraf rejection and the unclassifiable refusal; cancel is a no-op; a refusal dialog appears for a Lottie the importer rejects and its confirm is disabled; focus/Tab/Escape; sanitisation and the 40-entry cap |
| `e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts` (2 browser tests) | A `.kcs` project imports through the same control and a refused file changes nothing; the Lottie report flow still cancels and applies |
| `src/tests/ografBrowserZip.test.tsx` | The pre-existing OGraf manifest/package messages still fire (unchanged test) |

## 9. Validation matrix

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) | PASS |
| focused suites (`importDispatch`, `lottieImportEntry`, `lottieImport`) | PASS — 105 cases |
| `npm test` (full Vitest) | PASS — 122 files / 1,841 tests |
| `npm run lint` | clean |
| `npm run validate:ograf` | PASS |
| `npm run qa:release` | PASS — 2 Chromium smoke tests |
| `npx playwright test e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts` | PASS — 2 real-browser tests |
| `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | clean |

## 10. Protected invariants

- The validated import boundary remains the only path that turns text into a project.
- No change to `.kcs`, legacy, OGraf manifest or OGraf package outcomes.
- No renderer/evaluator change, no dependency, no `package.json`, lockfile or workflow change.
- Cancel still guarantees zero mutation for the report-driven import.

## 11. Residual risks

- **Unknown files now take the project path.** A malformed Lottie file can no longer open the Lottie
  report; it is refused with the project boundary's "not valid JSON" message. That is honest (nothing
  can be classified), but a user who renamed a Lottie file to something unrecognisable sees the
  project message instead of a Lottie one.
- **One control means one affordance.** The button no longer says "Lottie"; a user looking for a
  Lottie-specific entry point has to read the tooltip. The accepted kinds are named there and in the
  input's label.
- **OGraf packages are still refused**, by design: their import is the next slice, and the shared
  report dialog is ready for it.
- The dispatcher parses the text once more for the Lottie shape check; the size guard keeps that
  bounded, and the Lottie importer parses it again on accept.

## 12. Next work

OGraf package/editable import expansion on its own branch (Task 2 of the current orchestrator run),
reusing `ImportReportDialog` and the same validated apply path.

---

## 5. Next Session

# Next Session Handoff

## Repository state

- Checkout: `main` at or after `12b71a5` (the accepted code baseline), matching `origin/main`. **Milestone F item 10 is complete**: the import core (`ff32d6c`), the mask/track-matte slice (`8670b2a`), the text/image/precomp slice (`bda62cb`) and the import entry point with the report-before-replace UX (`3b30bff`) are merged; the checkpoint `docs/checkpoints/2026-09-18-after-lottie-core/` records the earlier base and stays historical. Milestones A–E, the Milestone F study, the item-11 harness, item 12's first step and product half, the CI hotfix and **all four Milestone F item 10 slices (merged at `ff32d6c`, `8670b2a`, `bda62cb` and `3b30bff`)** are in `main`. The feature branches `feat/export-onboarding`, `chore/state-hygiene-gate`, `chore/dependency-warning-audit`, `chore/warning-maintenance`, `docs/milestone-e-ograf-qa-study` and `feat/lottie-import-core` are retained as review artefacts.
- Milestone A (canvas tangent handles) is integrated into `main` by approved replay + fast-forward; `main` is a strict superset of its previous state
- Task 105 (export diagnostics UX) and Task 107 (track-matte source selection) are integrated by fast-forward; both are retained
- Workflow-tested release code candidate (tag target): `46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6`
- Release tags: `v1.1.0-rc.1` (annotated) and `v1.1.0-public-controls`, both unchanged
- Branches kept: `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` (Milestone A review artefact) and `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay` (identical to `main`; deleting it needs approval)

## Current result

Milestones A–E are complete, and Milestone F item 10 is complete (all four slices merged):

- Milestone F item 10, first slice — **the Lottie import core is merged into `main`** at `ff32d6c` (base `06a5dfcf`, `--no-ff`, pushed; branch `feat/lottie-import-core` kept at `f76ae6a`): `importLottieDocument(text)` maps document timing, shape/solid/null layers, transforms, paths, primitives and fill/stroke/trim, applies the segment-to-keyframe easing rules, and reports every construct it does not convert through the loss-report contract. 37 contract cases; five independent read-only review rounds (BLOCKED, BLOCKED, BLOCKED, READY WITH WARNINGS, READY WITH WARNINGS) plus a merge-eligibility review of the last delta. The importer now has a user-facing entry point (`3b30bff`): the header offers a separate "Import Lottie" control that parses the document in memory, shows the report before anything is applied, and applies only on an explicit confirm.

- Milestone A — canvas tangent authoring (`077911b`): vertex selection shows Bezier handles on the stage, dragging reshapes the path live, one history entry per completed drag, `Escape` cancels.
- Milestone B — graph + keyboard accessibility (`96e8f9d`): named keyframe diamonds with a lane-local arrow walk, a labelled value graph with keyboard-editable points, decorative SVG hidden from assistive tech, focus rings.
- Milestone C — first export / onboarding (`c2dcb22`): opt-in "First export help" panel, readiness check reading the same OGraf diagnostics authority as the export, one shared compile path for readiness and both export actions.
- Milestone D item 6 — state consistency check (`b91e8b9`, CI follow-up `be76df9`): `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs`.
- Milestone D item 9 — dependency and warning maintenance: **the audit is complete** (`reports/progress_112_dependency_warning_audit.md`, review closed READY WITH WARNINGS in round 6 of six) and **the approved Option A is implemented on `chore/warning-maintenance`** (`reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md`): W1 Fast Refresh split, W2 chunk splitting, W3 jsdom stubs, W4 honest dependency arrays, W5 `.gitattributes`, the D9-2 checker rule, plus the local SQLite binding repair — the API starts again and `GET /api/health` returns 200 in this working copy. `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.github/workflows/**` and every dependency version are unchanged. Audit findings that remain open by decision: 20 outdated rows over 21 package names (7 patch / 12 minor / 1 no-wanted-update; across two toolchain groups / three package names a newer major is available — `typescript` 6→7 and the Vitest pair `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4→5), `npm audit` 7 findings (6 moderate, 1 high; only `qs` and `undici` moderate in the production tree), the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin. It is merged.

The release stance is unchanged: annotated tag `v1.1.0-rc.1` and a GitHub draft prerelease exist at the workflow-tested code candidate; nothing was published, finalized, or pushed to npm.

## Validation

Full Vitest (123 files / 1,850 tests), `npx vitest run src/tests/ografPackageImport.test.ts src/tests/importDispatch.test.ts src/tests/lottieImportEntry.test.tsx src/tests/lottieImport.test.ts src/tests/ografBrowserZip.test.tsx` (132 cases), `npx playwright test e2e/lottie-import-report.spec.ts` (1 real-browser test), `npm run validate:ograf`, `npm run qa:release` (2 Chromium tests, candidate `12b71a5`), `npm run build`, `npm run lint` (clean), `git diff --check` and `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` (PASS: 32 checks at the accepted baseline `12b71a5`, 33 with the reconciliation bundle) all pass on `main`; the newest CI run on `main` at the time of writing is `35704676331` (success).

## Next scoped work

1. **Milestone F — item 12 unified import entry is implemented on `feat/unified-import-entry`** (`reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md`): one header control decides from the file's content what it is — `.kcs` and legacy through the validated boundary, Lottie through the report dialog, OGraf manifests/packages through their existing refusal — and **the merge decision for that branch is with the user**. Item 10 is complete and merged (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`): the "Import Lottie" control parses the document in memory, shows blocker/warning counts and every diagnostic with its source path and next step before anything is applied, cancels without touching the project, applies only on an explicit confirm through the existing `importProject` authority, and reconciles imported layer types onto existing KCS types the OGraf export accepts. The **OGraf package/editable import** is implemented on `feat/ograf-editable-import` (`reports/progress_129_ograf_editable_import.md`): the package is decoded in memory with entry/path guards and its `scene.kcs` is applied through the validated project path, with the merge decision still with the user. After it: the approval-gated package and toolchain follow-ups (Option B, `engines`/`allowScripts`, Option C) — each on its own branch with its own review and merge gate. Also open, each approval-gated: Option B (7 patch + 12 minor updates + a bounded `npm audit fix`, needs `package.json`/lockfile approval), Option C (TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 majors on their own branch), the `engines` declaration, and the npm-12 `allowScripts` decision.
2. Milestone F's delivered work: the study, item 10's design, its four merged slices (the import core, masks/track mattes, text/image/precomp, and the import entry point), item 11 (measurement only, on `chore/evaluator-profiling-harness`), and item 12's first step (merged) plus product half (on `feat/kcs-import-product-half`). Anything beyond those scopes — item 12's unified import entry, OGraf package import, Milestone E beyond items 7 and 8 — needs its own approval, and **D's dependency/package part (item 9 Option B) requires explicit user approval** before any `package.json`/lockfile work; all release/tag/draft-release changes need explicit approval.
3. Preserve the tag and draft release, and run an independent review before every merge.
4. Publish/finalize the GitHub draft only with further explicit user instruction.

## Guardrails

- Do not reset, force-push, rebase, tag, or delete branches/reports. Integrate by fast-forward, or by an approved replay.
- Do not modify `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\ograf-graphics`.
- Keep `.omp/config.yml`, model roles, provider mappings, task concurrency, and global tooling unchanged.
- Keep `origin/without-mask` untouched and classified ARCHIVE.
- Production draft is not published; publish/finalize requires further explicit user instruction.

## ChatGPT handoff policy

- `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a per-response, task-specific upload bundle: clean it first, then place only the files that this specific ChatGPT conversation needs.
- Preferred upload artifact: `chatgpt_handoff/CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` is regenerated from scratch for each task/milestone. Before writing it, delete or overwrite the old file. Build it only from the current `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` bundle plus `latest/OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md`. Do not append old content, do not preserve previous task sections, and do not use it as an archive. If a historical handoff archive is ever needed, create a separate explicitly named archive file under `chatgpt_handoff/archive/` only after user approval. The default ChatGPT upload is always this one file.
- Handoff documents must state one current truth: never append a correction block on top of stale sections — rewrite the stale section instead.
- Never store flattened source or test copies there. Those copies are separate files, and the ones named `src__*test*` are picked up by the Vitest default include glob, which breaks CI.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user's project/asset folder, not a handoff dump. Never copy the bundle there unless the user explicitly asks.
- Omitted files are never deleted from the repository; they simply are not part of the bundle.

## Milestone B merged — graph + keyboard accessibility

- Branch `feat/graph-accessibility` was fast-forward-merged into `main` at `96e8f9d0313cb81752c04fe58d6e7d00d700a6f4` (no merge commit, no rebase, no history rewrite).
- What it adds: timeline keyframe diamonds are named, focusable buttons (`Enter`/`Space` selects the keyframe and moves the playhead, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` walk focus along the lane in frame order and are consumed at the ends); the value graph is a labelled group whose keyframe points are Tab-reachable and announced with frame and value, editable with the arrow keys; decorative SVG geometry is hidden from assistive technology; the selected-keyframe panel is a group scoped to its frame; focus rings were added for the diamonds and the graph points.
- Review: one focused round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 documentation over-claims) — all closed; the re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS.
- Validation: 109 files / 1,652 Vitest tests, `validate:ograf`, `qa:release`, build, TypeScript, lint, `git diff --check`, plus the real-browser spec `e2e/graph-accessibility.spec.ts`.
- Out of scope (unchanged): graph engine or evaluator changes, new shortcut registry, keyframe model or drag redesign, new dependencies, release/package/workflow changes.
- Roadmap status when this milestone landed: D was next (items 6 and 9) and C was merged. Current status: A–E are complete and Milestone F is the active milestone (see "Current result" above).

## 6. Project State

# KCS Project State

## Current position

The accepted product and security follow-up line is integrated into main, and the grouped post-RC roadmap has completed milestones A–E. **Milestone F item 10 is complete**: the Lottie import core (`ff32d6c`), the mask/track-matte slice (`8670b2a`), the text/image/precomp slice (`bda62cb`) and the import entry point with the report-before-replace UX (`3b30bff`) are all merged, and `main` is at or after `12b71a5` (the reconciliation commit is the next `main` commit).

Annotated tag `v1.1.0-rc.1` was created and pushed at workflow-tested code candidate `46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6`. The GitHub release exists as a draft prerelease; no npm publication occurred.

**Checkpoint `2026-09-18-after-lottie-core`** (`docs/checkpoints/2026-09-18-after-lottie-core/`) records this state: `main` / `origin/main` is at `47d3368a2b54…`, the Lottie import core (Milestone F item 10, first slice) was merged with `--no-ff` at `ff32d6c` and pushed, and its branch `feat/lottie-import-core` is kept at `f76ae6a` as the review artefact. The checkpoint folder carries the summary (`README.md`), the tasklist (`TASKLIST.md`), a copy-paste next-session prompt (`RESUME_PROMPT.md`) and a machine-readable summary (`STATE.json`); the task record is `reports/progress_124_checkpoint_after_lottie_core.md`. The Milestone F study is merged (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`); **item 11 (evaluator profiling) is implemented** on `chore/evaluator-profiling-harness` as measurement only (`reports/progress_118_evaluator_profiling.md`), **item 12’s first step (validated import boundary)** is merged at `44218a6` (`reports/progress_119_kcs_import_boundary.md`), its **product half** (compatibility matrix executed as fixtures, the legacy migration report, and the autosave restore routed through the same boundary) is implemented on `feat/kcs-import-product-half` (`reports/progress_121_kcs_import_product_half.md`), and **item 10’s mapping design** is delivered in `docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`; item 10’s **first implementation slice (the import core)** is **merged into `main`** at `ff32d6c` (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`), its **second slice — layer masks + track mattes — is merged at `8670b2a`** (`reports/progress_125_lottie_mask_matte_slice.md`), its **third slice — text, image and precomp layers — is merged at `bda62cb`** (`reports/progress_126_lottie_text_image_precomp_slice.md`), and its **final slice — the import entry point with the report-before-replace UX — is merged at `3b30bff`** (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`): a separate "Import Lottie" control parses the document in memory, shows blockers and losses before anything is applied, cancels as a true no-op, applies only on an explicit confirm through the existing project authority, and reconciles imported layer types onto existing KCS types the OGraf export accepts; item 10 is therefore complete. Milestone F item 10 is then complete apart from the follow-ups listed below.

- Task 105 (export diagnostics remediation UX): blocking OGraf export diagnostics carry a stable title, the failing layer or feature, and a concrete next step; warnings are grouped into one non-blocking notification; user-authored values are formatted at every construction site so machine paths, URL credentials/query, embedded payloads, and raw OS messages never reach a diagnostic, a thrown error, or a toast.
- Task 107 (track-matte source selection affordance): the matte source relation, whichever model holds it, is resolved by one shared helper that mirrors the rendered relationship, so the outliner indicator shows what the stage actually applies; the Track Matte V2 card keeps its self-excluded source list, `None` clearing, and field preservation, and unnamed layers fall back to their ids in both source pickers.
- **Milestone A (canvas tangent handle authoring) — MERGED.** Selecting a single freeform layer in edit mode shows its vertices on the stage; clicking a vertex reveals its Bezier tangent handles; dragging a handle reshapes the rendered path live; double-clicking a vertex toggles corner ↔ smooth with neighbour-derived symmetric handles. One history entry per completed drag; `Escape` cancels a drag without recording one.
  - Integration path: the original branch `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` was reviewed across six rounds (final verdict `READY`, all five findings closed) and replayed onto current `main` as `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay`, then fast-forward merged. No rebase, no merge commit, no force push, no history rewrite.
  - Not covered: vertex add/remove, multi-vertex transforms, keyboard nudging, handle constraints, boolean or trim-enabled freeform layers, broadcast mode.

The release tag `v1.1.0-public-controls` remains unchanged. The `without-mask` branch remains a preserved archive candidate.

## Accepted baseline

Public Controls V1, OGraf Package Export V2, host compatibility work, Windows path hardening, parent/broadcast hardening, SourcePath/filesystem hardening, mask/matte parity, deterministic OGraf fixture validation, the isolated release smoke gate, the export diagnostics remediation UX, the track-matte source selection affordance, and Milestone A canvas tangent handle authoring are present in the accepted main line. OMP tooling remains separate.

## Validation status

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full Vitest | PASS | 121 files / 1,836 tests |
| OGraf fixture validation | PASS | `npm run validate:ograf` — offline against the vendored closure, every document pin-verified (`reports/progress_115_ograf_offline_schema_closure.md`) |
| OGraf release smoke | PASS | `npm run qa:release`; 2 Playwright tests — latest run at `12b71a5` on `main` |
| Real-browser milestone smoke | PASS | `e2e/graph-accessibility.spec.ts` and the live editor smoke with port 5000 closed (layer authoring, readiness check, real export) |
| State consistency | PASS | `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` — 32 checks at the accepted code baseline `12b71a5`, 33 with this reconciliation's bundle (the total scales with the number of bundle documents scanned) |
| TypeScript | PASS | `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) — the gate CI runs; `npx tsc --noEmit` alone does not cover the same project program (see `reports/progress_122_ci_hotfix_import_boundary_types.md`) |
| Lint | PASS | clean — the Fast Refresh warning was removed in `reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md` |
| Production build | PASS | no chunk-size advisory — split into 382.19 kB app + react-vendor/icons/geometry chunks (see `reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md`) |
| Independent review | PASS | Milestone A `READY` in round 6 of six; the item-9 audit closed `READY WITH WARNINGS` in round 6 of six (`reports/progress_112_dependency_warning_audit.md` §12); the Option A change closed with `READY WITH WARNINGS` from the read-only `scout` round (the reviewer model hit a provider usage limit) after `reviewer-agent` rounds 1–3 closed every finding (`reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md` §2) |
| CI on `main` | PASS | run `35704676331` (the Lottie import entry handoff) — success at the time of this reconciliation |

## Remaining work

- Grouped roadmap execution plan: `docs/KCS_GROUPED_ROADMAP_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`; roadmap items 1 and 2 are completed, and **Milestone A is merged**.
- **Milestone B (graph + keyboard accessibility, item 4) — MERGED** at `96e8f9d`: the timeline keyframe diamonds are named keyboard buttons with a lane-local arrow walk, the value graph exposes a labelled group with keyboard-editable points, decorative SVG geometry is hidden from assistive tech, and focus rings were added. One review round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 over-claims), all closed; the re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS.
- **Milestone C (first export / onboarding flow, item 5) — MERGED** at `c2dcb22` (final gate verdict READY WITH WARNINGS): an opt-in "First export help" panel, a readiness check that reads the same OGraf diagnostics authority the export reads, and one shared compile path used by the readiness check and both export actions. **Milestone D is complete** — item 6 and item 9 (audit, the approved Option A and the local SQLite repair) are merged at `3923141` (`reports/progress_112_dependency_warning_audit.md`, `reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md`). Milestone E (study plus items 7 and 8) is complete, and Milestone F is the active milestone: its study is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`), item 11 is implemented as measurement only, item 12's first step and product half are merged, item 10's mapping design is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`) and **item 10's first implementation slice — the Lottie import core — is merged at `ff32d6c`** (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`). Milestone F item 10 is complete: its four slices are merged (`ff32d6c`, `8670b2a`, `bda62cb`, `3b30bff`), and **item 12's unified import entry is implemented on `feat/unified-import-entry`** (`reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md`): one header control classifies a selected file by its content and routes it to the KCS/legacy boundary, the Lottie importer with its report dialog, or the existing OGraf refusal — with the merge decision still with the user. Its **OGraf package/editable import** is implemented on `feat/ograf-editable-import` (`reports/progress_129_ograf_editable_import.md`): a `.zip`/`.ograf` package is decoded in memory under entry-count, entry-size and path-safety guards, its `scene.kcs` goes through the same validated path as a project import, and a bare `.ograf.json` manifest still points the user at the package. After it lands: the approval-gated package and toolchain follow-ups (Option B, `engines`/`allowScripts`, Option C). The state-consistency checker does not yet detect a stale sentence inside a current section, so these documents are still reviewed by hand after every task. Follow-ups stay approval-gated before any `package.json`, lockfile, or workflow change: Option B, Option C, the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin.
- Publish/finalize the GitHub draft only with further explicit user instruction.
- No npm publication occurred; package remains private at `1.1.0-rc.1`.
- Branch cleanup needs approval: `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay` is identical to `main` and can be deleted whenever the user approves; `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` is kept as the Milestone A review artefact.

## ChatGPT handoff policy

- `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` holds a minimal, task-specific upload bundle, refreshed for each ChatGPT response instead of accumulating context files.
- `chatgpt_handoff/CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` is regenerated from scratch for each task/milestone. Before writing it, delete or overwrite the old file. Build it only from the current `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` bundle plus `latest/OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md`. Do not append old content, do not preserve previous task sections, and do not use it as an archive. A historical handoff archive, if ever needed, is a separate explicitly named file under `chatgpt_handoff/archive/` and only after user approval.
- Every handoff document states one current truth: a correction is never appended on top of a stale section — the stale section is rewritten.
- Flattened source and test copies must not live there: the Vitest default include glob picks up files named `src__*test*`, which failed CI runs `35094144225` and `35095655446`.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user's project/asset workspace, not a handoff destination.

## Protected state

- The current main documentation commits are intentionally newer than the tag target; the tag remains on the workflow-tested code candidate.
- `v1.1.0-public-controls` remains unchanged.
- `origin/without-mask` remains untouched and classified ARCHIVE.
- `.omp/config.yml` retains `memory.backend: mnemopi`.
- Model roles, provider mappings, task concurrency, and global OMP configuration remain unchanged.
- Candidate package version is `1.1.0-rc.1`; package remains private and unreleased.

## Milestone B merged — graph + keyboard accessibility

- Branch `feat/graph-accessibility` was fast-forward-merged into `main` at `96e8f9d0313cb81752c04fe58d6e7d00d700a6f4` (no merge commit, no rebase, no history rewrite).
- What it adds: timeline keyframe diamonds are named, focusable buttons (`Enter`/`Space` selects the keyframe and moves the playhead, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` walk focus along the lane in frame order and are consumed at the ends); the value graph is a labelled group whose keyframe points are Tab-reachable and announced with frame and value, editable with the arrow keys; decorative SVG geometry is hidden from assistive technology; the selected-keyframe panel is a group scoped to its frame; focus rings were added for the diamonds and the graph points.
- Review: one focused round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 documentation over-claims) — all closed; the re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS.
- Validation: 109 files / 1,652 Vitest tests, `validate:ograf`, `qa:release`, build, TypeScript, lint, `git diff --check`, plus the real-browser spec `e2e/graph-accessibility.spec.ts`.
- Out of scope (unchanged): graph engine or evaluator changes, new shortcut registry, keyframe model or drag redesign, new dependencies, release/package/workflow changes.
- **Milestone D item 6 — state consistency check — MERGED** at `b91e8b9` (follow-up `be76df9`): `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` fails when the live docs contradict the tag/`main` SHA, when the roadmap and the next action disagree, when the handoff upload instruction is superseded, or when the bundle carries source/test/binary copies, collapsed Windows paths or secret markers (see `reports/progress_111_state_hygiene_gate.md`).
- **Item 9 (dependency and warning maintenance) — MERGED at `3923141`** (audit, Option A warning maintenance and the local SQLite repair). The audit is complete (`reports/progress_112_dependency_warning_audit.md`, review closed READY WITH WARNINGS in round 6 of six) and the approved **Option A is implemented** on `chore/warning-maintenance` (`reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md`): W1 Fast Refresh split, W2 chunk splitting, W3 jsdom stubs, W4 honest dependency arrays, W5 `.gitattributes`, the D9-2 checker rule and the repair of **D9-1** (the local `sqlite3` NAPI binding is extracted; `node server/index.js` starts and `GET /api/health` returns 200 in this working copy). No dependency was updated and `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and the workflows are unchanged by that maintenance work; only its approval-gated follow-ups (Option B, Option C, the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin) are still open. The 7 catalogued warnings are resolved except W6 (`e2e/**` outside the Vitest glob by design) and W7 (environment `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR`). Still open by decision: 20 outdated rows over 21 package names (7 patch / 12 minor / 1 no-wanted-update; majors available for `typescript` 6→7 and the Vitest pair 4→5), the 7 `npm audit` findings (6 moderate, 1 high; `qs` and `undici` moderate in the production tree), the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin.

## 7. Current Roadmap Plan and Changelog

# KCS Grouped Roadmap Execution Plan

Orchestrator close-out for the grouped post-RC roadmap run. Milestone A was later completed, re-reviewed, and fast-forward merged into `main` (see `reports/progress_108_canvas_tangent_authoring.md`); milestone B was completed, re-reviewed, and fast-forward merged into `main` (see `reports/progress_109_graph_accessibility.md`); milestone C was completed, re-reviewed (final gate verdict READY WITH WARNINGS), and fast-forward merged into `main` (see `reports/progress_110_export_onboarding.md`); milestone D item 6 (state consistency check) was completed, re-reviewed, and fast-forward merged into `main` while item 9's audit and its approved Option A are merged and only its follow-ups (Option B, Option C, `engines`, the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin) stay behind an explicit approval gate (see `reports/progress_111_state_hygiene_gate.md`); milestone E items 7 and 8 are implemented and merged at `22335a5`, and Milestone F's study is delivered while its implementation proceeds slice by slice under separate approvals: item 10 is complete (all four slices merged), item 11 is implemented, item 12's first step and product half are merged, and item 12's unified import entry is the next work.

## Milestone map and status

Follow-ups stay approval-gated: Option B (patch/minor updates + `npm audit fix`), Option C (TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5), the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin |
| E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study | 7, 8 | `docs/milestone-e-ograf-qa-study`, `chore/ograf-offline-schema-closure`, `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` | **COMPLETE** — study and plan delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_E_OGRAF_QA_STUDY.md`, `reports/progress_114_ograf_qa_study.md`); **item 7 (7-A) implemented and merged** on `chore/ograf-offline-schema-closure` (`reports/progress_115_ograf_offline_schema_closure.md`) and **item 8 implemented and merged** on `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` (`reports/progress_116_ograf_folder_qa.md`), integrated at `22335a5` with green CI. **Plan only** for anything beyond those two approved scopes |
| F — Interop design and its approved slices | 10, 11, 12 | `docs/milestone-f-interop-study` | **NEXT** — the study is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`, `reports/progress_117_interop_study.md`): item 10 Lottie mapping contract, item 11 evaluator profiling plan, item 12 editable-KCS-import product/security plan. **Plan only** for every slice that has not been approved yet. **Item 11 approved and implemented** on `chore/evaluator-profiling-harness` (`reports/progress_118_evaluator_profiling.md`): deterministic scenes, an on-demand harness and a first baseline; measurement only, no caching. **Item 12 first step implemented** on `fix/kcs-import-boundary-hardening` (`reports/progress_119_kcs_import_boundary.md`): a validated import boundary with stable refusal codes and limits; item 10 is designed in `docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`, and **item 10's first implementation slice (the Lottie import core) is merged at `ff32d6c`** (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`); its **second slice (layer masks + track mattes) is merged at `8670b2a`** (`reports/progress_125_lottie_mask_matte_slice.md`), its **third slice (text, image and precomp layers) is merged at `bda62cb`** (`reports/progress_126_lottie_text_image_precomp_slice.md`), and its **final slice (the import entry point with the report-before-replace UX) is merged at `3b30bff`** (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`) — **item 10 is complete**. Checkpoint `2026-09-18-after-lottie-core` |

Completed earlier: item 1 (export diagnostics remediation UX, Task 105), item 2 (track-matte source selection affordance, Task 107).

## Milestone A — the blocker list that was closed (historical record)

From `reports/progress_108_canvas_tangent_authoring.md` §7:

1. Normalize legacy points in `resolveFreeformPath` (`normalizeClosedPoints`) to match the contract.
2. Complete the §7 selection model: handle-selection state, empty-canvas "clear overlay selection only", and resetting the overlay selection when the selected layer changes.
3. Restrict the Escape listener to the drag lifetime and close the batch deterministically for a pointerdown-then-Escape with no move.
4. Build the contract's verification matrix: real-origin coordinate parity under rotation/non-uniform/negative scale; behaviour tests for every `StageCanvas` eligibility guard (extract the guard list into a pure predicate so it is testable); canonical-path priority; real `useHistory` undo/redo/cancel entry counts; serialization/import round-trip of a materialized path; OGraf byte-parity for an untouched canonical path; one manual editor smoke.
5. Decide the smooth-handle-at-anchor edge: dragging a handle exactly onto its anchor must not silently collapse the counterpart (`Math.hypot(...) || 1`).

All five items were closed, the focused re-review and its follow-up rounds returned READY, and the milestone was replayed and fast-forward merged into `main` (`077911b`) with a green CI run. This list is history, not open work.

## Milestone B — Graph + keyboard accessibility (roadmap item 4)

- Scope: keyboard reachability and screen-reader labelling for graph/path editing surfaces that already exist (`TemporalGraphPanel`, keyframe rows, selected-keyframe sections).
- Constraints: no graph engine rewrite, no broad style churn, reuse existing graph/value/channel authorities.
- Validation: focused keyboard/a11y tests, one Playwright smoke, full suite, independent review.
- Gate: stop if the work grows beyond narrow UI/accessibility.

## Milestone C — First export / onboarding flow (roadmap item 5)

- Scope: a short "first successful OGraf export" path for new users, reusing the Task 105 diagnostics, existing templates, and the existing export UI.
- Constraints: no host/vendor contract invention, no package format change, no `Desktop\KCS` interaction.
- Validation: onboarding/sample fixture tests, `qa:release`, full suite, independent review.

## Milestone D — State / CI / warning hygiene (roadmap items 6, 9)

- Item 6 (current-state consistency check) is a documentation/tooling task: a small script or CI check that fails when live docs contradict the tag/main SHA. No gate beyond normal review.
- Item 9 (dependency and warning maintenance) **requires explicit user approval for anything that touches `package.json`/`package-lock.json`**. The audit is complete (`reports/progress_112_dependency_warning_audit.md`), the approved **Option A** (warning fixes only, no package change) is implemented and **merged** at `3923141` (`reports/progress_113_warning_maintenance.md`); Option B, Option C, the `engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` pin stay approval-gated.

## Milestone E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study (roadmap items 7, 8)

- Item 7 (offline schema closure): **7-A approved and implemented** — the eight pinned documents (33,567 B) are vendored under `fixtures/ograf/schema/` with both upstream notices in `NOTICE.md`; `npm run validate:ograf` is offline and deterministic by default and verifies every pin, `--online` is the refresh path, and the existing CI step needed no change. Evidence: `reports/progress_115_ograf_offline_schema_closure.md`.
- Item 8 (downstream folder QA automation): **approved and implemented** — the generator, the ZIP/folder comparison and the host-limited report live on `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` and reuse the canonical compiler and path-safety authorities, with the QA root as an explicit required argument. Evidence: `reports/progress_116_ograf_folder_qa.md`.

## Milestone F — Interop design and its approved slices (roadmap items 10, 11, 12)

The deliverables are the study, the Lottie import mapping design and the editable-KCS-import plan; implementation runs slice by slice, each slice behind its own approval. The study is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`) and fixes each deliverable contract; **item 11 is implemented** (`perf/sceneBuilder.ts`, `perf/evaluator-profile.perf.ts`, `src/tests/evaluatorProfileScenes.test.ts`, `reports/progress_118_evaluator_profiling.md`) as measurement only — no caching, no threshold; **item 12’s first step (validated import boundary) is implemented** (`src/utils/importValidation.ts`, `reports/progress_119_kcs_import_boundary.md`), its **product half** (compatibility matrix, migration report, autosave through the boundary) on `feat/kcs-import-product-half` (`reports/progress_121_kcs_import_product_half.md`), and **item 10’s mapping design is delivered** (`docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`, `reports/progress_120_lottie_mapping_design.md`) with its four open questions settled by the user, and its **first implementation slice (the import core)** is **merged into `main` at `ff32d6c`** (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`): document timing, shape/solid/null layers, transforms, shapes and the segment-to-keyframe easing rules, with every unconverted construct reported; its **second slice (layer masks + track mattes)** is merged at `8670b2a` (`reports/progress_125_lottie_mask_matte_slice.md`) with the 8-mask limit restored, its **third slice (text, image and precomp layers)** is merged at `bda62cb` (`reports/progress_126_lottie_text_image_precomp_slice.md`), and its **import entry point with the report-before-replace UX** is merged at `3b30bff` (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`), **item 12's unified import entry is merged at `ce6cec2`** (`reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md`) — one control that classifies by content and keeps the existing `.kcs`, legacy and OGraf routing — and its **OGraf package/editable import** is implemented on `feat/ograf-editable-import` (`reports/progress_129_ograf_editable_import.md`); **no further implementation without a separate explicit approval**, and the design gate in §Approval gates applies before any code. The historical checkpoint `2026-09-18-after-lottie-core` records the state after the first slice only.

## Approval gates

- Package/lockfile/workflow/dependency changes: explicit user approval required before editing.
- Release/tag/draft-release/npm: explicit user approval required; unchanged by this run.
- Interchange work (Lottie, editable KCS import): design approval before code.
- Any milestone that grows into a broad refactor: stop and report.

## Handoff policy (unchanged)

`chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a minimal, task-specific bundle: `README.md`, `manifest.txt`, the current report(s), `NEXT_SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and optionally the directly relevant contract/plan docs. Never source or test files — flattened copies named `src__*test*` matched Vitest's include glob and broke CI in runs `35094144225`/`35095655446`. Never copy the bundle into `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS`.

## Recommended next prompt

"KCS MILESTONE F — ITEM 12 UNIFIED IMPORT ENTRY (approval-gated). Item 10 is complete and merged (import core `ff32d6c`, masks/track mattes `8670b2a`, text/image/precomp `bda62cb`, import entry point + report-before-replace UX `3b30bff`); `main` is at or after `12b71a5`. Replace the fragmented user-facing import controls with one controlled entry that dispatches `.kcs`, legacy KCS, `.ograf.json`, OGraf package/ZIP and Lottie, behind a shared report/decision surface, using only the import capabilities that already exist — no new OGraf editable-import conversion, no package/lockfile/workflow change. Suggested branch `feat/unified-import-entry`; the OGraf package/editable import expansion is the slice after it, and every release/tag/npm action stays behind its own explicit approval."

Historical notes: "KCS MILESTONE A COMPLETION …" was carried out (five items closed, READY, replayed and fast-forward merged at `077911b`); "KCS MILESTONE B — GRAPH + KEYBOARD ACCESSIBILITY …" was carried out (merged at `96e8f9d`); "KCS MILESTONE C — FIRST EXPORT / ONBOARDING FLOW …" was carried out: implemented on `feat/export-onboarding`, gate-reviewed (READY WITH WARNINGS) and fast-forward merged at `c2dcb22` (see `reports/progress_110_export_onboarding.md`).

# Changelog

All notable changes to **Keyframe Character Studio** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- OGraf packages are importable: selecting the `.zip`/`.ograf` the exporter wrote opens a report and, on confirm, replaces the project with the scene the package carries. The archive is decoded in memory with entry-count, entry-size and package-path guards, prototype keys and unsafe, duplicate or reserved paths are refused, and a package without a scene is refused rather than half-imported.
- One import control in the header instead of several: the selected file is classified by what it **contains**, so a KCS project, a legacy project, an OGraf manifest and a Lottie animation all import through the same button, each with its existing behaviour (and the Lottie animation still showing its report before anything is replaced).
- A Lottie (bodymovin) import path: selecting a Lottie file parses it in memory and opens a report that lists the blockers and the losses with their source paths and next steps **before** anything is applied — Cancel leaves the project untouched, and only "Import and replace project" applies the scene through the same validated path the project import uses. Imported layers keep the shapes, text and images they had: a path, a rectangle, a rounded rectangle, an ellipse and a solid all become a freeform whose own path draws exactly the imported geometry, while text and images keep their existing KCS types — so an imported scene neither loses its curves nor risks an export refusal caused only by the layer type the importer picked.
- A state consistency check for the repository: `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` fails when the live documents contradict the tag/`main` SHA, when the roadmap and the next action disagree, or when the handoff bundle carries a stale status, a superseded upload instruction, source/test copies, collapsed Windows paths or secret markers.
- A first-export path for new users: a labelled "First export help" panel next to Export lists the three steps, offers a readiness check that reports what would block an OGraf export (reusing the existing export diagnostics), and states that nothing is written until you export. The readiness answer is a pre-flight summary; a scene changed afterwards is recompiled when the export runs.
- The timeline keyframe diamonds are keyboard operable: each one is a named button in the tab order, `Enter`/`Space` selects the keyframe and moves the playhead (and selects the part on the parent lane), and `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` walk focus along the lane in frame order.
- The value graph's keyframe points are announced with their frame and value, and its decorative axes and curve stay out of the accessibility tree; the selected-keyframe panel is exposed as a group scoped to its frame.
- Bezier tangent handles can be authored directly on the stage: select a single freeform layer, click a vertex to reveal its handles, drag a handle to reshape the path live, and double-click a vertex to toggle corner ↔ smooth. Each drag is a single undo step and `Escape` cancels one without recording history.
- Track-matte source relationships are now visible in the outliner for both relationship models (`Mask → <source name>`), and unnamed layers fall back to their ids in the matte source pickers.
- The Track Matte V2 card's source select carries an accessible label.
- Actionable OGraf export diagnostics: every blocking diagnostic now reports a stable title, the failing layer or feature, the reason, and a concrete next step, and it never reports success while export is blocked.
- Non-blocking OGraf warnings are surfaced as a compact grouped notification instead of being silently dropped.
- Package materialization failures now carry stable failure codes; filesystem guidance states the trusted-directory requirement, the unsupported hostile-concurrency case, and avoids claiming perfect OS-level protection. Machine paths are reduced to a display-safe form.

### Changed
- The value and speed graphs are exposed as labelled groups instead of images, and focus rings were added for the timeline diamonds and the graph keyframe points.
- Freeform paths that only carry legacy `points` normalize a repeated closing vertex before the editing overlay materializes a canonical `path` on first edit; the legacy array itself is preserved.
- Matte relationship resolution went through one shared helper that mirrors the rendered result, so the outliner indicator and the stage agree for enabled, disabled, missing, and unusable sources.

### Release candidate `1.1.0-rc.1` (unreleased package metadata)
- Consolidates the accepted Public Controls, OGraf packaging, filesystem hardening, schema-validation, and release-smoke work.
- The Git tag and GitHub draft prerelease exist; this changelog entry remains under `[Unreleased]` because the package is private and was not published.

### Security
- Hardened prototype-sensitive imported OGraf keys, package paths, MIME lookups, and generated runtime maps.
- Hardened SVG input boundaries, source-path handling, output filesystem checks, hierarchy, broadcast state, and mask/matte parity.
- The `1.1.0-rc.1` candidate records accepted operational warnings for hostile-concurrency filesystem mutation and network-dependent schema validation.
