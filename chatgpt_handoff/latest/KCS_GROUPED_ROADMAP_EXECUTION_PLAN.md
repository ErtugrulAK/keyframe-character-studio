# KCS Grouped Roadmap Execution Plan

Orchestrator close-out for the grouped post-RC roadmap run. Main stays at `d3aa135bdf8d63b9cb01b21f2b2f4c14f7973c72`; nothing from this run is merged.

## Milestone map and status

| Milestone | Roadmap items | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Canvas path authoring UX (tangent handles) | 3 | `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` @ `eb1f1a1` | Implemented + validated; all five review blockers closed and re-reviewed; **not merged** (branch and `main` diverged: no fast-forward) |
| B — Graph + keyboard accessibility | 4 | — | Not started |
| C — First export / onboarding flow | 5 | — | Not started |
| D — State / CI / warning hygiene | 6, 9 | — | Plan only |
| E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study | 7, 8 | — | Plan only |
| F — Architecture exploration only | 10, 11, 12 | — | Plan only |

Completed earlier: item 1 (export diagnostics remediation UX, Task 105), item 2 (track-matte source selection affordance, Task 107).

## Milestone A — remaining work before merge

From `reports/progress_108_canvas_tangent_authoring.md` §7:

1. Normalize legacy points in `resolveFreeformPath` (`normalizeClosedPoints`) to match the contract.
2. Complete the §7 selection model: handle-selection state, empty-canvas "clear overlay selection only", and resetting the overlay selection when the selected layer changes.
3. Restrict the Escape listener to the drag lifetime and close the batch deterministically for a pointerdown-then-Escape with no move.
4. Build the contract's verification matrix: real-origin coordinate parity under rotation/non-uniform/negative scale; behaviour tests for every `StageCanvas` eligibility guard (extract the guard list into a pure predicate so it is testable); canonical-path priority; real `useHistory` undo/redo/cancel entry counts; serialization/import round-trip of a materialized path; OGraf byte-parity for an untouched canonical path; one manual editor smoke.
5. Decide the smooth-handle-at-anchor edge: dragging a handle exactly onto its anchor must not silently collapse the counterpart (`Math.hypot(...) || 1`).

Then: one focused re-review, fast-forward merge, push, CI check, report update, minimal handoff refresh.

## Milestone B — Graph + keyboard accessibility (roadmap item 4)

- Scope: keyboard reachability and screen-reader labelling for graph/path editing surfaces that already exist (`TemporalGraphPanel`, keyframe rows, selected-keyframe sections).
- Constraints: no graph engine rewrite, no broad style churn, reuse existing graph/value/channel authorities.
- Validation: focused keyboard/a11y tests, one Playwright smoke, full suite, independent review.
- Gate: stop if the work grows beyond narrow UI/accessibility.

## Milestone C — First export / onboarding flow (roadmap item 5)

- Scope: a short "first successful OGraf export" path for new users, reusing the Task 105 diagnostics, existing templates, and the existing export UI.
- Constraints: no host/vendor contract invention, no package format change, no `Desktop\KCS` interaction.
- Validation: onboarding/sample fixture tests, `qa:release`, full suite, independent review.

## Milestone D — State / CI / warning hygiene (roadmap items 6, 9)

- Item 6 (current-state consistency check) is a documentation/tooling task: a small script or CI check that fails when live docs contradict the tag/main SHA. No gate beyond normal review.
- Item 9 (dependency and warning maintenance) **requires explicit user approval**: it touches `package.json`/`package-lock.json`. Present the proposed dependency deltas and the warning inventory first, then wait.

## Milestone E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study (roadmap items 7, 8)

- Item 7 (offline schema closure) needs a licensing/size decision before any implementation; deliverable is a study with a hash closure proposal, not a change to fail-closed behaviour.
- Item 8 (downstream folder QA automation) must preserve the evidence-backed folder import model and must not invent host contracts.

## Milestone F — Architecture exploration only (roadmap items 10, 11, 12)

Research/design deliverables only: Lottie import mapping design, evaluator profiling plan, editable KCS import plan. No implementation without a separate explicit approval.

## Approval gates

- Package/lockfile/workflow/dependency changes: explicit user approval required before editing.
- Release/tag/draft-release/npm: explicit user approval required; unchanged by this run.
- Interchange work (Lottie, editable KCS import): design approval before code.
- Any milestone that grows into a broad refactor: stop and report.

## Handoff policy (unchanged)

`chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a minimal, task-specific bundle: `README.md`, `manifest.txt`, the current report(s), `NEXT_SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and optionally the directly relevant contract/plan docs. Never source or test files — flattened copies named `src__*test*` matched Vitest's include glob and broke CI in runs `35094144225`/`35095655446`. Never copy the bundle into `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS`.

## Recommended next prompt

"KCS MILESTONE A COMPLETION — close the five review items on `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring`, build the contract's verification matrix, run one focused re-review, fast-forward merge if READY, then refresh the minimal handoff." Milestones B and C follow only after A is merged or explicitly deferred.
