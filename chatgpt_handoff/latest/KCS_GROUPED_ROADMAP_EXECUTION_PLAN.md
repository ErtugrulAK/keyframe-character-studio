# KCS Grouped Roadmap Execution Plan

Orchestrator close-out for the grouped post-RC roadmap run. Milestones A–G are complete. Milestone H is complete through H6 and its release decision remains held at H7. The later approved maintenance run closed dialog focus restoration (`5cb8a45`), runtime SQLite repository hygiene (`b3f3c6c`), the API CORS allowlist (`2a313d7`), Oxlint 1.85 (`feca773`), and TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 (`37904fb`) without moving any release artefact. The post-hold Astra remediation then closed findings F-01…F-10 through `8a4ca22` (see `reports/progress_151_astra_remediation.md`), also without moving any release artefact.

## Milestone map and status

| Milestone | Roadmap items | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Canvas path authoring UX (tangent handles) | 3 | `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` (replayed as `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay`) | **MERGED** — five review findings closed across six rounds (final verdict READY), fast-forward merged into `main` |
| B — Graph + keyboard accessibility | 4 | `feat/graph-accessibility` | **MERGED** — one review round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 over-claims), all closed; re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS; fast-forward merged at `96e8f9d` |
| C — First export / onboarding flow | 5 | `feat/export-onboarding` | **MERGED** — six review rounds; final gate verdict READY WITH WARNINGS; fast-forward merged into `main` at `c2dcb22` |
| D — State / CI / warning hygiene | 6, 9 | `chore/state-hygiene-gate`, dependency/toolchain maintenance branches | **COMPLETE** — the state checker, Option A, Option B, `engines`/npm-12 `allowScripts`, `jsdom` 30.1.1, Oxlint 1.85, and TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 are merged. The later maintenance run also removed the runtime SQLite database from tracking, restricted API browser origins, and restored dialog opener focus. Latest maintenance commit: `37904fb` |
| E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study | 7, 8 | `docs/milestone-e-ograf-qa-study`, `chore/ograf-offline-schema-closure`, `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` | **COMPLETE** — study and plan delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_E_OGRAF_QA_STUDY.md`, `reports/progress_114_ograf_qa_study.md`); **item 7 (7-A) implemented and merged** on `chore/ograf-offline-schema-closure` (`reports/progress_115_ograf_offline_schema_closure.md`) and **item 8 implemented and merged** on `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` (`reports/progress_116_ograf_folder_qa.md`), integrated at `22335a5` with green CI. **Plan only** for anything beyond those two approved scopes |
| F — Interop design and its approved slices | 10, 11, 12 | `docs/milestone-f-interop-study` | **COMPLETE** — the study is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`, `reports/progress_117_interop_study.md`): item 10 Lottie mapping contract, item 11 evaluator profiling plan, item 12 editable-KCS-import product/security plan. **Plan only** for every slice that has not been approved yet. **Item 11 approved and implemented** on `chore/evaluator-profiling-harness` (`reports/progress_118_evaluator_profiling.md`): deterministic scenes, an on-demand harness and a first baseline; measurement only, no caching. **Item 12 first step implemented** on `fix/kcs-import-boundary-hardening` (`reports/progress_119_kcs_import_boundary.md`): a validated import boundary with stable refusal codes and limits; item 10 is designed in `docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`, and **item 10's first implementation slice (the Lottie import core) is merged at `ff32d6c`** (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`); its **second slice (layer masks + track mattes) is merged at `8670b2a`** (`reports/progress_125_lottie_mask_matte_slice.md`), its **third slice (text, image and precomp layers) is merged at `bda62cb`** (`reports/progress_126_lottie_text_image_precomp_slice.md`), and its **final slice (the import entry point with the report-before-replace UX) is merged at `3b30bff`** (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`) — **item 10 is complete**; **item 12 is complete and merged** (the unified import entry with its handoff refresh at `a4f8642`, the OGraf package/editable import at `419fc6a`); and **item 9 Option B** (dependency maintenance) is merged into `main` at `73426e5`. Checkpoint `2026-09-18-after-lottie-core` |
| G — Post-review correctness follow-up | review findings H-01…M-05 | one branch per task (`fix/modal-shortcut-isolation`, `fix/import-serialization-transaction-integrity`, `fix/lottie-structure-correctness`, `fix/ograf-inverse-alpha-matte`, `fix/api-network-trust-boundary`, `fix/evaluator-profile-fixtures`, `fix/state-consistency-live-docs`) | **COMPLETE** — the full-project review's release-blocking findings, taken one at a time: each gets its own branch, its own validation, a read-only self-review and an approval-gated fast-forward merge. H-01 (blocking dialogs left the editor's global commands live) is merged at `0c19751`; H-03/H-04/M-03 (import boundary validation, the track authoring-state round-trip and the document transaction) at `fc672f2`; M-01/M-02/H-05 (Lottie parent resolution, static hierarchy and multi-geometry loss) at `85c3929`; H-02 (the OGraf inverted track matte) at `ac3bda1`; H-06 (the unauthenticated API bound to every interface) at `352d272`; M-04 (the evaluator profile fixtures) at `16e1610`. **M-05** (the live-document reconciliation) is merged at `2b0bba0`, and the shallow-checkout CI regression it caused was fixed at `dcbf9f5`, and the final correctness gate ran on `main` after that fix (`reports/progress_141_astra_correctness_followup_summary.md`): every finding is closed. |
| H — Release finalization and approval-gated maintenance | review follow-up decisions | Milestone H branches plus the five maintenance branches plus the nine remediation branches | **NEXT (held)** — **H1–H6 are COMPLETE**, the post-hold maintenance tasks are merged through `37904fb`, and the Astra remediation findings F-01…F-10 are closed through `8a4ca22`. **H7 = HOLD** by user decision: no tag, release, or npm action; artefacts stay at `46d2a3e`. This row keeps the plan's single NEXT marker because the only remaining plan decision is a future explicitly authorized release action. |

Completed earlier: item 1 (export diagnostics remediation UX, Task 105), item 2 (track-matte source selection affordance, Task 107).

## Milestone A — the blocker list that was closed (historical record)

From `reports/progress_108_canvas_tangent_authoring.md` §7:

1. Normalize legacy points in `resolveFreeformPath` (`normalizeClosedPoints`) to match the contract.
2. Complete the §7 selection model: handle-selection state, empty-canvas "clear overlay selection only", and resetting the overlay selection when the selected layer changes.
3. Restrict the Escape listener to the drag lifetime and close the batch deterministically for a pointerdown-then-Escape with no move.
4. Build the contract's verification matrix: real-origin coordinate parity under rotation/non-uniform/negative scale; behaviour tests for every `StageCanvas` eligibility guard (extract the guard list into a pure predicate so it is testable); canonical-path priority; real `useHistory` undo/redo/cancel entry counts; serialization/import round-trip of a materialized path; OGraf byte-parity for an untouched canonical path; one manual editor smoke.
5. Decide the smooth-handle-at-anchor edge: dragging a handle exactly onto its anchor must not silently collapse the counterpart (`Math.hypot(...) || 1`).

All five items were closed, the focused re-review and its follow-up rounds returned READY, and the milestone was replayed and fast-forward merged into `main` (`077911b`) with a green CI run. This list is history, not open work.

## Milestone B — Graph + keyboard accessibility (roadmap item 4)

- Scope: keyboard reachability and screen-reader labelling for graph/path editing surfaces that already exist (`TemporalGraphPanel`, keyframe rows, selected-keyframe sections).
- Constraints: no graph engine rewrite, no broad style churn, reuse existing graph/value/channel authorities.
- Validation: focused keyboard/a11y tests, one Playwright smoke, full suite, independent review.
- Gate: stop if the work grows beyond narrow UI/accessibility.

## Milestone C — First export / onboarding flow (roadmap item 5)

- Scope: a short "first successful OGraf export" path for new users, reusing the Task 105 diagnostics, existing templates, and the existing export UI.
- Constraints: no host/vendor contract invention, no package format change, no `Desktop\KCS` interaction.
- Validation: onboarding/sample fixture tests, `qa:release`, full suite, independent review.

## Milestone D — State / CI / warning hygiene (roadmap items 6, 9)

- Item 6 (current-state consistency check) is a documentation/tooling task: a small script or CI check that fails when live docs contradict the tag/main SHA. No gate beyond normal review.
- Item 9 and its approved follow-ups are complete: Option A (`3923141`), Option B (`73426e5`), `engines`/npm-12 `allowScripts` (`1a12d79`), `jsdom` 30.1.1 (`c1431db`), Oxlint 1.85 (`feca773`), and TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 (`37904fb`).

## Milestone E — OGraf QA / schema hardening study (roadmap items 7, 8)

- Item 7 (offline schema closure): **7-A approved and implemented** — the eight pinned documents (33,567 B) are vendored under `fixtures/ograf/schema/` with both upstream notices in `NOTICE.md`; `npm run validate:ograf` is offline and deterministic by default and verifies every pin, `--online` is the refresh path, and the existing CI step needed no change. Evidence: `reports/progress_115_ograf_offline_schema_closure.md`.
- Item 8 (downstream folder QA automation): **approved and implemented** — the generator, the ZIP/folder comparison and the host-limited report live on `test/ograf-folder-qa-automation` and reuse the canonical compiler and path-safety authorities, with the QA root as an explicit required argument. Evidence: `reports/progress_116_ograf_folder_qa.md`.

## Milestone F — Interop design and its approved slices (roadmap items 10, 11, 12)

The deliverables are the study, the Lottie import mapping design and the editable-KCS-import plan; implementation runs slice by slice, each slice behind its own approval. The study is delivered (`docs/design/KCS_MILESTONE_F_INTEROP_STUDY.md`) and fixes each deliverable contract; **item 11 is implemented** (`perf/sceneBuilder.ts`, `perf/evaluator-profile.perf.ts`, `src/tests/evaluatorProfileScenes.test.ts`, `reports/progress_118_evaluator_profiling.md`) as measurement only — no caching, no threshold; **item 12’s first step (validated import boundary) is implemented** (`src/utils/importValidation.ts`, `reports/progress_119_kcs_import_boundary.md`), its **product half** (compatibility matrix, migration report, autosave through the boundary) on `feat/kcs-import-product-half` (`reports/progress_121_kcs_import_product_half.md`), and **item 10’s mapping design is delivered** (`docs/design/KCS_LOTTIE_IMPORT_MAPPING.md`, `reports/progress_120_lottie_mapping_design.md`) with its four open questions settled by the user, and its **first implementation slice (the import core)** is **merged into `main` at `ff32d6c`** (`reports/progress_123_lottie_import_core.md`): document timing, shape/solid/null layers, transforms, shapes and the segment-to-keyframe easing rules, with every unconverted construct reported; its **second slice (layer masks + track mattes)** is merged at `8670b2a` (`reports/progress_125_lottie_mask_matte_slice.md`) with the 8-mask limit restored, its **third slice (text, image and precomp layers)** is merged at `bda62cb` (`reports/progress_126_lottie_text_image_precomp_slice.md`), and its **import entry point with the report-before-replace UX** is merged at `3b30bff` (`reports/progress_127_lottie_import_entry_report_ux.md`), **item 12's unified import entry is merged** (`reports/progress_128_unified_import_entry.md`) — one control that classifies by content and keeps the existing `.kcs`, legacy and OGraf routing — and its **OGraf package/editable import** is merged into `main` at `419fc6a` (`reports/progress_129_ograf_editable_import.md`), with the handoff refresh at `a4f8642`; **no further implementation without a separate explicit approval**, and the design gate in §Approval gates applies before any code. The historical checkpoint `2026-09-18-after-lottie-core` records the state after the first slice only.

## Approval gates

- Package/lockfile/workflow/dependency changes: explicit user approval required before editing.
- Release/tag/draft-release/npm: explicit user approval required; unchanged by this run.
- Interchange work (Lottie, editable KCS import): design approval before code.
- Any milestone that grows into a broad refactor: stop and report.

## Handoff policy (unchanged)

`chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a minimal, task-specific bundle: `README.md`, `manifest.txt`, the current report(s), `NEXT_SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and optionally the directly relevant contract/plan docs. Never source or test files — flattened copies named `src__*test*` matched Vitest's include glob and broke CI in runs `35094144225`/`35095655446`. Never copy the bundle into `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS`.

## Recommended next prompt

"KCS RELEASE FINALIZATION (Milestone H, approval-gated — currently HELD). Milestone H is complete through H6, and the five approved post-hold maintenance tasks are merged with green CI through `37904fb`: dialog focus restoration, runtime SQLite repository hygiene, the exact API CORS allowlist, Oxlint 1.85, and TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5.

The release decision H7 remains a HOLD. `v1.1.0-rc.1`, the GitHub draft prerelease, and the private package metadata are unchanged at `46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6`; nothing was published. A future publish, finalization, or re-tag remains a separate explicit decision."

Historical notes: "KCS MILESTONE A COMPLETION …" was carried out (five items closed, READY, replayed and fast-forward merged at `077911b`); "KCS MILESTONE B — GRAPH + KEYBOARD ACCESSIBILITY …" was carried out (merged at `96e8f9d`); "KCS MILESTONE C — FIRST EXPORT / ONBOARDING FLOW …" was carried out: implemented on `feat/export-onboarding`, gate-reviewed (READY WITH WARNINGS) and fast-forward merged at `c2dcb22` (see `reports/progress_110_export_onboarding.md`).
