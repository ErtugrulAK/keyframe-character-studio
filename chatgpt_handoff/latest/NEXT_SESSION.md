# Next Session Handoff

## Repository state

- Checkout: `main` at or after `37904fb`, matching `origin/main` after the five-task maintenance run. The run closed dialog focus restoration (`5cb8a45`), runtime SQLite repository hygiene (`b3f3c6c`), the exact API CORS allowlist (`2a313d7`), Oxlint 1.85 adoption (`feca773`), and the aligned TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 upgrade (`37904fb`). Milestones A–G remain complete, Milestone H remains complete through H6, and its release decision remains held (H7). The historical checkpoint `docs/checkpoints/2026-09-18-after-lottie-core/` remains unchanged.
- Milestone A (canvas tangent handles) is integrated into `main` by approved replay + fast-forward; `main` is a strict superset of its previous state
- Task 105 (export diagnostics UX) and Task 107 (track-matte source selection) are integrated by fast-forward; both are retained
- Checkout after the item 12 merge: `main` at or after `a4f8642` (the OGraf package import and its handoff refresh), matching `origin/main`
- Milestone D item 9 **Option B is merged into `main` at `73426e5`** (`reports/progress_130_dependency_maintenance_option_b.md`) and `main` matches `origin/main`
- The **`engines` declaration and the npm-12 `allowScripts` question are answered on `chore/engines-allow-scripts`** (`reports/progress_131_engines_allow_scripts.md`): `engines.node: "^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0"` (the locked toolchain's supported intersection) plus a version-pinned `allowScripts` approval for `sqlite3@6.0.1`; `package-lock.json` mirrors only the root engine metadata and its dependency graph is unchanged (**merged into `main` at `1a12d79`**)
- Workflow-tested release code candidate (tag target): `46d2a3e59e065816d972dcd56951803951b577f6`
- Release tags: `v1.1.0-rc.1` (annotated) and `v1.1.0-public-controls`, both unchanged
- Branches kept: `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring` (Milestone A review artefact) and `feat/canvas-tangent-authoring-replay` (identical to `main`; deleting it needs approval)

## Current result

Milestones A–E are complete, and Milestone F item 10 is complete (all four slices merged):

- Milestone F item 10, first slice — **the Lottie import core is merged into `main`** at `ff32d6c` (base `06a5dfcf`, `--no-ff`, pushed; branch `feat/lottie-import-core` kept at `f76ae6a`): `importLottieDocument(text)` maps document timing, shape/solid/null layers, transforms, paths, primitives and fill/stroke/trim, applies the segment-to-keyframe easing rules, and reports every construct it does not convert through the loss-report contract. 37 contract cases; five independent read-only review rounds (BLOCKED, BLOCKED, BLOCKED, READY WITH WARNINGS, READY WITH WARNINGS) plus a merge-eligibility review of the last delta. The importer now has a user-facing entry point (`3b30bff`): the header offers a separate "Import Lottie" control that parses the document in memory, shows the report before anything is applied, and applies only on an explicit confirm.

- Milestone A — canvas tangent authoring (`077911b`): vertex selection shows Bezier handles on the stage, dragging reshapes the path live, one history entry per completed drag, `Escape` cancels.
- Milestone B — graph + keyboard accessibility (`96e8f9d`): named keyframe diamonds with a lane-local arrow walk, a labelled value graph with keyboard-editable points, decorative SVG hidden from assistive tech, focus rings.
- Milestone C — first export / onboarding (`c2dcb22`): opt-in "First export help" panel, readiness check reading the same OGraf diagnostics authority as the export, one shared compile path for readiness and both export actions.
- Milestone D item 6 — state consistency check (`b91e8b9`, CI follow-up `be76df9`): `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs`.
- Milestone D item 9 and its maintenance follow-ups are closed. Option A is merged at `3923141`, Option B at `73426e5`, `engines`/npm-12 `allowScripts` at `1a12d79`, `jsdom` 30.1.1 at `c1431db`, Oxlint 1.85 at `feca773`, and Option C (TypeScript 7 plus Vitest and `@vitest/coverage-v8` 5) at `37904fb`. The runtime SQLite file is ignored rather than tracked, API browser origins are exact by default, and the two remaining dialogs restore opener focus.

The release stance is unchanged: annotated tag `v1.1.0-rc.1` and a GitHub draft prerelease exist at the workflow-tested code candidate; nothing was published, finalized, or pushed to npm.

## Validation

On `main` at `37904fb`: TypeScript 7.0.2 and Vitest 5.0.2 pass `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, full Vitest (128 files / 1,951 tests), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run validate:ograf`, `npm run qa:release` (2 Chromium tests), the export/Lottie/matte browser specs (8 tests), `npm run qa:v6` (3 tests), `npm run check`, `node scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs`, `npm audit` (0 vulnerabilities), and `git diff --check`. The five maintenance commits each have a green `main` CI run; the latest is `36315904883`.

## Next scoped work

1. **Milestone H remains HELD at H7.** H1–H6 are complete, the release artefacts remain at `46d2a3e`, and no tag, GitHub release, or npm publication action was taken.
2. The five maintenance tasks that followed the hold are complete: focus restoration, SQLite repository hygiene, the API CORS allowlist, Oxlint 1.85, and TypeScript 7 / Vitest 5 are merged with green CI.
3. Preserve the tag and draft prerelease. Publishing, finalizing, or re-tagging requires a new explicit user instruction.
4. The GitHub Actions Node 20 deprecation annotation and the announced `ubuntu-latest` migration to Ubuntu 26 are non-blocking workflow-maintenance warnings; they do not change the held release decision.

## Guardrails

- Do not reset, force-push, rebase, tag, or delete branches/reports. Integrate by fast-forward, or by an approved replay.
- Do not modify `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\ograf-graphics`.
- Keep `.omp/config.yml`, model roles, provider mappings, task concurrency, and global tooling unchanged.
- Keep `origin/without-mask` untouched and classified ARCHIVE.
- Production draft is not published; publish/finalize requires further explicit user instruction.

## ChatGPT handoff policy

- `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` is a per-response, task-specific upload bundle: clean it first, then place only the files that this specific ChatGPT conversation needs.
- Preferred upload artifact: `chatgpt_handoff/CHATGPT_UPLOAD_ONEFILE.md` is regenerated from scratch for each task/milestone. Before writing it, delete or overwrite the old file. Build it only from the current `chatgpt_handoff/latest/` bundle plus `latest/OMP_FINAL_RESPONSE.md`. Do not append old content, do not preserve previous task sections, and do not use it as an archive. If a historical handoff archive is ever needed, create a separate explicitly named archive file under `chatgpt_handoff/archive/` only after user approval. The default ChatGPT upload is always this one file.
- Handoff documents must state one current truth: never append a correction block on top of stale sections — rewrite the stale section instead.
- Never store flattened source or test copies there. Those copies are separate files, and the ones named `src__*test*` are picked up by the Vitest default include glob, which breaks CI.
- `C:\Users\ertugrul.ak\Desktop\KCS` is the user's project/asset folder, not a handoff dump. Never copy the bundle there unless the user explicitly asks.
- Omitted files are never deleted from the repository; they simply are not part of the bundle.

## Milestone B merged — graph + keyboard accessibility

- Branch `feat/graph-accessibility` was fast-forward-merged into `main` at `96e8f9d0313cb81752c04fe58d6e7d00d700a6f4` (no merge commit, no rebase, no history rewrite).
- What it adds: timeline keyframe diamonds are named, focusable buttons (`Enter`/`Space` selects the keyframe and moves the playhead, `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` walk focus along the lane in frame order and are consumed at the ends); the value graph is a labelled group whose keyframe points are Tab-reachable and announced with frame and value, editable with the arrow keys; decorative SVG geometry is hidden from assistive technology; the selected-keyframe panel is a group scoped to its frame; focus rings were added for the diamonds and the graph points.
- Review: one focused round returned BLOCKED (3 findings, 6 documentation over-claims) — all closed; the re-review returned READY WITH WARNINGS.
- Validation: 109 files / 1,652 Vitest tests, `validate:ograf`, `qa:release`, build, TypeScript, lint, `git diff --check`, plus the real-browser spec `e2e/graph-accessibility.spec.ts`.
- Out of scope (unchanged): graph engine or evaluator changes, new shortcut registry, keyframe model or drag redesign, new dependencies, release/package/workflow changes.
- Roadmap status when this milestone landed: D was next (items 6 and 9) and C was merged. Current status: milestones A–G are complete, and Milestone H is complete through H6 with its release decision held (H7), see "Current result" above.
